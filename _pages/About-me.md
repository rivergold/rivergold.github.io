I'm Kevin Ho, a researcher of machine learning and data mining. Most of my work is about huamn activity recognition and relevant ML algorithm. Now, I am studying at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chendu, China.

Windfall is a blog to record my learng curve of computer vision and machine learning. Why it's called <i>Windfall</i>? It means that keep doing and one day you will get what you want, just like the squashy fruits fallen off trees.
<!-- I am also a fan of kaggle data mining competition and have finished the Titanic and digit recognition competition. It is challenging but interesting! -->

Be myself, do what I like and enjoy life.

Gratefull thanks to my parents and friends for their love and supports, and my girlfriend Kelly for coming up with a name for this blog.

<!-- - I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->
