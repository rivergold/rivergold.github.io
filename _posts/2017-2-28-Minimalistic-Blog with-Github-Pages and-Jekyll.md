6. Create blog with Jekyll:
- One way, you can build a new blog folder by `jekyll new <file name>`
- Another way, you can using jekyll themes and templates online, here are some good themes which are minimalistic :
    - [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)
    - [chalk](https://github.com/nielsenramon/chalk)

By the way, my blog is built based on _Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme_ which is created by [mmistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes). I love this minimalistic  theme and it is very easy to install with `ruby gem`.

7. Jekyll base tutorials:
    - What is Jekyll or how to understand it?
    In my view, it is a framework offer you website templates and can convert .md into html. One of the most important concepts and tools of Jekyll is __Layout__, which defines and provides html templates to you. Another important thing is __YAML Front Matter__, a config command just like _yaml_. The __YAML Front Matter__ must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines. Here is a basic example:
    ```
        ---
        layout: post
        title: Blogging Like a Hacker
        ---
    ```

    - Here are common command of Jekyll:
     - `jekyll new <file name>`
     Create a new blog file

     - `jekyll build`
     Build your blog.

     - `bundle exec jekyll serve`
     Use local serve to preview your blog

     For more details, you should browse [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

8. Add **Comment** to your blog.
