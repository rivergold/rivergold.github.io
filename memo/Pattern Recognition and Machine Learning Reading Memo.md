# Basics
## Understanding key of Probability
- Obserations: X
- Result: Y
- Model parameters: $\theta$

## Parametrics Method and Nonparametric Method
Parametrics Method
: These methods assumes a specific functional form for the distribution, for example the Gaussian distrubution.

Nonparametric Method
: Withour assuming a specific functional form for the distribution.

## Two theory of parameters estimation in **Parametrics Distributions**
Frequentist Theory
: we choose specific values for the parameters by optimizing some criterion, such as likelihood function

Bayesian Theory
: we introduce prior distributions over the parameters and then use Bayes' theorem to compute the corresponding posterior distribution given the observed data.

需要注意的是，这种表示方法，n是在上面的

# Graphical Models
## Basics
Bayesian Networks
: also known as *directed graphical models*

Markov Random Fields
: also known as undirected graphical models

For the purpose of solving inference problems, it is often convenient to convert both directed and undirected graphs into a different representation called a *factor graph*.
