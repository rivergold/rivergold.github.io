# Basics
- Understand event, signal and slot in PyQt:
    - event: when user or others take a action(such as click a button, internet connected), the object state will change, it is a event.
    - signal: after the object state changed, it will sent a signal.
    - slot: When a specific signal emitted, corresponding function will execute, it is called slot.

- Qt QGraphicsView, QGraphicsScene and QGraphicsItem
    Good framework to show 2D Graph.<br>

    - What need to do
        1. Set GraphicsScene SceneRect
            SceneRect of GraphicsScene sets the size of thescene, using `QGraphicsScene.setSceneRect(QRect(x,y, width, height))` to do this.
            `x, y` is coordinate in `QGraphicsScene` coordinatesystem, which is as following shows,

            </p>

        2. Set GraphicsView SceneRect
            SceneRect of GraphicsView set the range thatGraphicsView can `see` in GraphicsScene. By using`QGraphicsView.setSceneRect(QRect(x, y, width,height))` to set it. `x, y` is coordinate in`GraphicsScene` coordinate system, and according tomy own experience, it is good to set SceneRect ofGraphicsView as same as SceneRect of GraphicsScene.

        3. Pay attention to `QGraphicsItem` coordinate system
            The `QGraphicsItem` coordinate system defines theelement(such as text, image and so on) postion inthe `QGraphicsItem`. The origin of  `QGraphicsItem`coordinate system may be the Top-Left point ofelement or the center of the element. It means that `QGraphicsItem` maybe draw the element fromdifferent start point. For example,`QGraphicsPixmapItem` will draw the pixmap from theitem's(0, 0), you can use`QGraphicsPixmapItem.setOffset()` to move pixmapcenter at origin. It is a good usual practice tobrowse the Qt official manual.

# Common functions:
- `QWidget.setGeometry(x, y, w, h)`  
Locate window on screen and set it size.

- QtGui.DesktopWidget class provides information about the user's desktop, including the screen size.

# Problems and solutions
- Python3.5 on windows os use `pip install pyqt5`, when import PyQt5 modules occur error `ImportError: The Dll load failed: the specified module could not be found`
    - when using pip install pyqt5.8, it is 32bits which is not support 64bits. One solution is installing pyqt5.6.
