# Invariance and Equivariance

- [Quora: What is the difference between equivariance and invariance in Convolution neural networks?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-equivariance-and-invariance-in-Convolution-neural-networks)

Invariance and equivariance are two important properties in image feature representations.

Invariance means the internal representation of an object doesnâ€™t change when the properties of that object change.

Equivariance means the internal representation captures the properties of the object.
